# This readme file will be deleted on deployment

This is a demo case of using a Github Action to automatically apply a template script that
updates the name and description within files to match the name and description on the
repository. The script is then deleted and the workflow becomes disabled (workflows cannot 
be deleted from within a workflow).

To see this in action, click the big green `Use this template` button to create a new repo,
and then wait for the action to complete.
